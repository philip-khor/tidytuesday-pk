# Manual random check on suspicious looking screen names 

Some are cleaning services, city councils/community volunteers, social media influencers sharing tweets on how to be tidy, and community R accounts that are unlikely to amount to user submissions. I manually look up some screen names to be sure. 

To filter for user submissions, I use the following (rather crude) rules: 

 - People posting from the [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) app are filtered out. Buffer is a social media management app - it's unlikely that participants are posting from Buffer.
